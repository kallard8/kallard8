<p>Hi! My name's Keira. I love design. My favorite type of design is human-centered design. It doesn't matter how good a design is if you can't use it. I love feedback, and that includes more harsh feedback. That's because all design can always be improved. This doesn't mean I don't apprieciate designs I like! One of my favorite games is Stardew Valley. I could go on and on about how well the game was designed. However, the game still is improved with updates even though it is so successful. I strive to bring this kind of growth mindset to a team.</p>
